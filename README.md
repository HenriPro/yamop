YAMOP (Yet Another Music Organizer and Player)

Is a an easy to use simple local music organizer and player. 
YAMOP is cross platform, requiring only a folder containing tagged music to start.

On first load YAMOP will ask which directory to load music from. This is saved, and will not be asked for again.

YAMOP loads music from the song directory recursively at app launch, so if you load new music into your folder, just restart the app.
